# Rock-vs-Mine-Task2

This project is a part of my virtual internship at Orinson Technologies. It involves building a machine learning model to predict whether a given signal is a rock or a mine using sonar data. The model is developed in Python using various machine learning techniques.

# Introduction

The purpose of this project is to classify objects as either rocks or mines based on sonar data. This is important for applications in underwater exploration, where detecting whether an object is a natural formation or man-made is crucial.

# Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains sonar signals. It is comprised of 60 features for each sample, where each feature corresponds to a frequency response of the sonar signal. The labels indicate whether the object is a rock (R) or a mine (M).

Features:

60 numerical attributes representing the energy in different frequency bands.
Target:

'R' for Rock and 'M' for Mine.

# Modeling

The notebook includes the following steps:

Data Preprocessing: Cleaning the dataset and splitting it into training and testing sets.

Feature Engineering: Normalizing the data for better model performance.

Model Selection: We experimented with various machine learning models like:

Logistic Regression

Decision Trees

Random Forests

k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)

Support Vector Machines (SVM)

Evaluation: Models were evaluated based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

# Technologies Used

Python 3.x

Jupyter Notebook

Pandas for data manipulation

Scikit-learn for machine learning models

Matplotlib/Seaborn for data visualization

# Conclusion

This project demonstrated the application of machine learning to sonar data for object classification. Future improvements could include hyperparameter tuning, using deep learning models, or incorporating more advanced feature engineering techniques.
